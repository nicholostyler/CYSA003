life cycle (SDLC)
SDLC
+There are many approaches to the SDLC
+It typically starts with the identification of an unmet need and they typically end with a retirement of the software
+There are many tasks in this process and many places where cybersecurity experts are needed
+Typical tasks include:
- Identify the organizational needs
- Design a solution
- Build a solution
- Test a solution
- Deploy the solution to production
- Maintain the solution
- Retire the solution
+There is a classic method of conducting the early phases of this lifecycle that is called the Waterfall method. More modern
approaches follow a paradigm called Agile. Scrum is an example of this technology.
