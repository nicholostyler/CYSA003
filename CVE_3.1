Impact Score
Exploitability Score
Impact Sub Score

Exploitability Metrics
**Attack Vector (AV)** 
Network (N) - Bound to the network stack. Can only come from external to your company through the internet.
Network Adjacent (NA) - Bound to the network stack but only comes from protocol level.
Local (L) - Needs hand on keyboard access.
Physical (P) - Needs physical access to computer.
**Attack Complexity (AC)**
Low (L) - Attacker can expect repeatable success with this.
High (H) - 
Attacker must gather knowledge about environment. 
Must prepare the target environment to exploit. 
The attacker must inject themselves into logical network path.
**Privileges Required (PR)**
None (N) - Attacker does not need any credentials to exploit.
Low (L) - Attacker just needs any user account
High (H) - Attacker needs admin rights.
**User Interaction (UI)**
None (N) - Can be exploited with no interaction from user.
Requried (R) - Successful exploitation requries user to interact with malware.
**Scope**
Unchanged (U) - Vulnerable component and the impact component are the same.
Changed (C) - Exploited vulnerability can affect resources beyond the scope.

Impact Metrics
**Confidenality (C)**
High (H) - Total lsos of confidentality resulting in all resources within the component to be in attackers hands.
Low (L) - Some loss of confidenality. Access to some restricted information is obtained.
None (N) - No data is lost.
**Integrity (I)**
High (H) - Total loss of interity, attacker is able to modify all files by the component.
Low (L) - Modification of data is possible but attacker does not have control over modification.
None (N) - No loss of integirty
**Availability (A)**
High (H) - Attacker is able to deny access to resources to impacted component
Low (L) - Performance is reduced or there are some interruptions.
None (N) - No impact to availability.
