- Asset Discovery
	- Map scans
		- Scanning a network for assets and endpoints
	- Device fingerprinting 
		- Information collected about a device for use in identification
- Special considerations
	- Scheduling
		- You would want to schedule the scans in a way that doesn't interfere with business needs.
	- Operations
		- You want to schedule the scan so that someone is there in case something goes wrong
	- Performance
		- You want to make sure the scan doesn't interfere with the performance of the server and endpoints to make sure they don't stop business.
	- Sensitivity levels
		- Certain machines might be more sensitive or contain information that needs to be scanned in a different way. 
	- Segmentation
		- Are the endpoints you want to scan in the same network as you? Are they airgapped?
	- Regulatory requirements
		- If you are in the medical, financial field you might be getting scanned differently than a privately owned company. 
- Internal vs external scanning
	- Are you running the scan from an internet network or are you being scanned externally? 
	- Internal you may be able to find more things vs an external scan.
- Agent vs agentless
	- An agent runs as admin on a server/system to constantly pull information from the device to send back to the SIEM.
	- Agentless simply relys on the network scanning to provide information or if you provide admin credentials to the scan.
- Credentialed vs non-credentialed
	- A credentialed scan is a scan that has admin rights. This will be able to determine the risk of what a user with admin rights can do.
	- non-credentialed can be handy to determine what a regular user has access to or how they could escalate privilege's to. 
- Passive vs active
	- Passive scanning is doing a scan that doesn't raise any red flags. What can I find by looking at network traffic?
	- Active scanning is actively trying to find something on the network. They are actively probing and measure the response they get back. 
- Static vs dynamic
	- Static is relying on hashes or reputation based scan on the software.
	- Dynamic actively looks at the code and the application is running. 
	- Reverse engineering
		- Using techniques to figure out how the code works by looking at methods and variables in the code
	- Fuzzing
		- The act of throwing random values at a program and seeing how it works. 
		- Does it work? Does it accept something it shouldn't? 
- Critical Infrastructure
	- Operational Technology (OT)
		- Hardware or software that detects and causes a change through direct monitoring. They manage devices that interact with the physical environment. Used in industry equipment.
	- Industrial Control Systems (ICS)
		- Collective term used to describe different types of control systems and associated instruments, devices, systems, networks and controls used in the process.
	- Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
		- Computer based system for gathering and analyzing real time data from control equipment. 
- Security baseline scanning
	- Scan the network and assets to know what the baseline is for your scan in the future. 
- Industry Frameworks
	- Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
		- PCI is used for things like credit cards. 
		- Is not 
	- Center for Internet Security (CIS) Benchmarks
		- Security tactics and hardening guides to make sure your security is on par with standards.
	- Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)
		- Used for benchmarks for securing web applications
	- International organization for Standardization (ISO)
		- If you certify with ISO your org follows the standards and have gone through security audits.
