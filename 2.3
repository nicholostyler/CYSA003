Common Vulnerability Scoring
System (CVSS) interpretation
- Attack vectors
  - how the attacker got into your network
  - n = network
  - a = adjacent
    - Network attack but is limited at the protocol level
  - l = local
  - p = physical
    - hands on keyboard 
- Attack complexity
  - How much work does it take for an attacker to get into your network
  - L = Low
  - H = High
- Privileges required
  - Does it require them to be an administrator?
  - L = Low
  - H = High
  - N = None
- User interaction
  - Does it require your employees to interact with the attacker to gain access
  - N = None
  - R = Required
- Scope
  - U = Unchanged
  - C = Changed
  - If it impacts resources beyong its security scope
- Impact
  - Critical = 9.0 - 10.0
  - High = 7.0 - 8.9
  - Medium = 4.0 - 6.9
  - Low = 1.0 - 3.9
o Confidentiality
  - Low to High score. 
  - High is the attakcer has full access to all resources
  - Low the attacker has partial access to information. 
o Integrity
  - Trustworthiness of information. Whether the information has been tampared with or changed. Can an attacker alter the accuracy of logs?
o Availability
  - Can an attacker deny access to resources?
• Validation
- True/false positives
- True/false negatives
• Context awareness
- Internal
  - Insider threat
- External
  - Attacker from the outside
- Isolated
  - Isolated from a vlan that is only allowed on specific individuals.
• Exploitability/weaponization
• Asset value
  - How sensitive is the information that was breached? 
• Zero-day
  - An attack that utilizes something that wasn't found by the developer.
